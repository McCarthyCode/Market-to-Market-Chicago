<div class="card">
  <h4 class="h4">MTM Chicago</h4>
  <p>
    MTM Chicago. We are a website dedicated to the LGBT community in Chicago, the State of Illinois, and the surrounding region. We will be focusing on nightlife, dining, arts and entertainment, sports, mental and physical health, fitness, travel, fashion, retail and non-profit work.
  </p>
  <p>
    What makes us different from other media sites is the way we work with businesses and people in the community. We will not only help promote each business via social media, photo spreads, and editorials, but also getting the community to know about people behind the business. This is one of our main focuses.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our other areas of focus include events organization, management and promotion. We currently promote and organize Out at Wrigley and the many pre- and post-parties bookending the event. We were also brought on this past year to help promote the Blackhawks first official Pride Night.

    Billy has been working in LGBT media in Chicago for over 20 years. In 2000, Billy secured an advertising contract with the Chicago Cubs, making them the first professional sports team to advertise in an LGBT publication, and solidifying the team as a staple in the Chicago LGBT community. The following year, he founded and organized the first-ever recognized Gay Day sporting event in the world, Out at the Ballgame (now branded Out at Wrigley, and still organized by Billy and MTM). Out at Wrigley is now entering its 20th year!
